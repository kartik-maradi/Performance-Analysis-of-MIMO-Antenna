Installation & Setup

Install CST Studio Suite – the primary simulation tool used for antenna modeling and analysis. 

Create a new project and set the operating frequency range (0.01–6 GHz as used in the report). 

Design the MIMO antenna structure (2×2 or 4×4 configuration) by creating microstrip patch elements on the FE-4 lossy substrate model. 

Assign waveguide ports to each antenna element for excitation.

Configure boundary conditions and mesh settings to ensure accurate simulation results.

Run the electromagnetic simulation to extract performance parameters such as S-parameters (S11, S21), field distribution, and field energy. 

Analyze propagation delay between antenna ports to study timing differences.

Export results from CST for reporting, plotting, or including in documentation.
